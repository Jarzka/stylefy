unique CSS class,\n   and returning a pointer (a map with :class keyword) to it so that the component can use it.\n   To keep the rendering process fast, use-style works asynchronously, meaning that it\n   does not add the generated CSS class into the DOM immediately, but very soon instead.\n   If the style has not been added into the DOM yet, it returns the given props as inline style,\n   so that the component looks good even if CSS class has not been generated yet.\n\n   Important exception: if the style contains specific modes or media query definitions,\n   which cannot be used as inline style, {:style {:visibility \\\"hidden\\\"}} is returned.\n   Thus, the component is going to be hidden for a few milliseconds.\n   In most cases, this is not a problem, but if you want to avoid it, see prepare-styles function.\n\n   The given 'style' parameter is a map which contains CSS style properties\n   (as supported by Garden library). There can also be special namespaced keywords\n   along with the style definitions. These are:\n\n   Core features:\n\n   ::sub-styles        Makes it possible to define a named style map inside of the main style map.\n                       The contents of ::sub-styles should be a map, in which keys define the name of\n                       the sub-style and values contain the style properties.\n                       Sub-styles are nothing special, they are supposed to contain the same contents\n                       as the main style map. ::sub-styles helps you to define styles that are closely\n                       related to the main style map but do not deserve their own 'def'.\n   ::mode              A map in which keys are mode names and values are style properties.\n                       Internally all modes are converted to CSS pseudoclasses or pseudoelements.\n                       You can use any mode name that is a valid CSS speudoclass.\n   ::media             A map in which keys are maps presenting CSS media query definitions, and values\n                       are style maps which are used when the media query is active.\n                       Vendor prefixes and modes can be used inside the media query style map.\n   ::supports          A map in which keys are strings presenting CSS feature query definitions, and values\n                       are style maps which are used when the supports query is active.\n                       Vendor prefixes, media queries and modes can be used inside the support query style map.\n   ::vendors           A vector of vendor prefixes that are used with ::auto-prefix.\n   ::auto-prefix       A set of style properties that should be prefixed with ::vendors.\n   ::with-classes      A collection of additional class names that should always be used with\n                       this style definition.\n\n   Additional features:\n\n   ::class-prefix      Custom prefix for generated class names. If not given, the default prefix will be used.\n                       Custom prefix can be used for debugging and automatic software testing purposes.\n                       Note that you need to set custom class prefixes on in the init function.\n   ::manual            Manual mode can be used to style child elements with manually written CSS selectors\n                       using Garden syntax. It should be used only for styling 3rd party components and\n                       resolving corner cases in which complex CSS selectors are needed.\n                       For the most part, it is recommended to use ::sub-styles.\n\n   Options is an optional map, which contains HTML attributes (:class, :href, :src etc.).\"\n  ([style] (use-style style {}))\n  ([style options]\n   (assert (or (map? style) (nil? style)) (str \"Style should be a map or nil, got: \" (pr-str style)))\n   (assert (or (map? options) (nil? options)) (str \"Options should be a map or nil, got: \" (pr-str options)))\n   #?(:cljs (impl-styles/use-style! style options (fn [style] (dom/save-style @dom/dom style)))\n      :clj  (impl-styles/use-style! style options (fn [{:keys [hash css]}]\n                                                    (swap! css-in-context assoc-in [:stylefy-classes hash] css))))))\n\n\n(defn use-sub-style\n  \"Defines style for a component using sub-style.\n\n   The style and options are the same as you would use with use-style.\n   sub-style is the name of the sub-stale in the given style map.\n\n   If you have a deeper sub-style nesting, ie. you want to get a sub-style from sub-style,\n   take a look at sub-style function.\"\n  ([style sub-style] (use-sub-style style sub-style {}))\n  ([style sub-style options]\n   (assert (or (map? style) (nil? style)) (str \"Style should be a map or nil, got: \" (pr-str style)))\n   (assert (or (map? options) (nil? options))\n           (str \"Options should be a map or nil, got: \" (pr-str options)))\n   #?(:cljs (impl-styles/use-sub-style! style sub-style options (fn [style] (dom/save-style @dom/dom style)))\n      :clj  (impl-styles/use-sub-style! style sub-style options (fn [{:keys [hash css]}]\n                                                                  (swap! css-in-context assoc-in [:stylefy-classes hash] css))))))\n\n(defn sub-style\n  \"Returns sub-style for a given style.\"\n  [style & sub-styles]\n  (assert (every? keyword? sub-styles) (str \"Sub style should be referenced by keyword, got: \" (pr-str sub-styles)))\n  (apply impl-styles/sub-style (apply conj [style] sub-styles)))\n\n(defn init\n  \"Initialises stylefy.\n\n  The following options are supported:\n\n  :global-vendor-prefixes     A map containing a set of ::stylefy/vendors and ::stylefy/auto-prefix properties.\n                              These properties are globally prefixed in all stylefy style maps.\n  :use-custom-class-prefix?

However, custom tag styles\n   can be useful for setting styles on base elements, like html or body.\n\n   Example:\n   (stylefy/tag \\\"code\\\"\n                 {:background-color \\\"lightyellow\\\"})\"\n  [name properties]\n  (assert (string? name) (str \"Tag name should be a string, got: \" (pr-str name)))\n  (assert (map? properties) (str \"Properties should be a map, got: \" (pr-str properties)))\n\n  (let [tag-as-css (conversion/style->css {:props properties :custom-selector name})]\n    #?(:cljs (do (dom/add-tag @dom/dom tag-as-css)\n                 nil)\n       :clj  (do (swap! css-in-context assoc-in [:tags name] tag-as-css)\n                 nil))))\n\n(defn class\n  \"Frontend: Creates a CSS class with the given name and properties and adds it into the DOM asynchronously.\n   Backend: Creates a CSS class with the given name and properties and adds it into the the current context.\n\n   Normally you should let stylefy convert your style maps to unique CSS classes by calling\n   use-style. Thus, there is usually no need to create customly named classes when using stylefy,\n   unless you work with some 3rd party framework.\n\n   Example:\n   (stylefy/class \\\"enter-transition\\\"\n                   {:transition \\\"background-color 2s\\\"})\"\n  [name properties]\n  (assert (string? name) (str \"Name should be a string, got: \" (pr-str name)))\n  (assert (map? properties) (str \"Properties should be a map, got: \" (pr-str properties)))\n\n  (let [class-as-css (conversion/style->css {:props properties :custom-selector (conversion/class-selector name)})]\n    #?(:cljs (do (dom/add-class @dom/dom class-as-css)\n                 nil)\n       :clj  (do (swap! css-in-context assoc-in [:classes name] class-as-css)\n                 nil))))\n\n;\n; Backend only\n;\n\n#?(:clj\n   (defn query-with-styles\n     \"Takes a query-fn, which is assumed to return HTML as text, and executes it.\n      If use-style is called during the execution, the generated CSS is kept in temporary memory.\n      When the query has finished, a special value of _stylefy-server-styles-content_ is searched\n      in the output and replaced with the generated CSS.
